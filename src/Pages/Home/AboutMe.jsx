            Hi, I'm Hossam, a Software Engineering student at Concordia University with a passion for building and learning new technologies. My journey in programming started in high school with Python, sparking my interest in software development and leading me to pursue my current studies.
            </p>
            <p className="hero-section-description">
            Now in my third year, I have experience with languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, and C, along with tools such as Git, ReactJS, and NodeJS. I’m actively involved in Concordia’s tech community as a Computer Science and Software Engineering Representative for the Engineering and Computer Science Association (ECA). In this role, I help organize professional development workshops, represent student interests, and foster collaboration between students and faculty.            </p>
            <p className="hero-section-description">
            Currently, I’m looking for a summer internship where I can apply my skills in a hands-on environment, contribute to exciting projects, and continue growing as a developer.
